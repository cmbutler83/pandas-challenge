PYCITY SCHOOL ANALYSIS OBSERVATIONS

After analyzing this data, I have have observed the following conclusions:

1. There is a strong implication that being in a charter school, helps students achieve higher math and reading scores overall as well as almost doubles their chance of passing overall.

2. Being in a small or medium school helps a student achieve slightly higher scores in reading and math, but significantly increases their chance to pass math and increase their overall passing rate.

3. Shockingly enough, the amount of spending per student has a negative correlation with the overall passing rate! As the spending goes up, the passing rate goes down!



**please note**

I did not use the formatting code suggested for the Per Student Budget. When I added this code, it converted my series to a string, and I was no longer able to use it in my final calculations.  I left the code in as a comment to show that it's there, but I could not find a way to show the dollar sign without changes the data type.
